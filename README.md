# Natural Language Processing (NLP) -  Project 2025

 Project repository for the **Introduction to Natural Language Processing** course taught during the Spring Semester at the **Department Of Informatics - University of Piraeus,Greece**. This course offers a hands-on and theoretical dive into modern NLP techniques, tools, and applications â€” **from foundational linguistics to deep learning and large language models**.

## Project Description

In this project, we will work with the two provided texts and aim to reconstruct them to enhance their semantic clarity and, where possible, improve their grammatical accuracy as well.
