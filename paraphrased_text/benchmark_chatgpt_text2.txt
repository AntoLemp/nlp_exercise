During our final discussion, I mentioned the new submission—the one we had been waiting on since last autumn. However, the update was a bit confusing, as it didn’t seem to include the full feedback from the reviewer or perhaps the editor.
In any case, I believe the team—despite some delays and reduced communication recently—really did their best with the paper and the overall collaboration.
We should all be grateful for the acceptance and the efforts made, especially now that the Springer link finally came through last week.
Also, please kindly remind me if the doctor still plans to edit the acknowledgments section before resending the paper.
I haven’t seen the final version of that part yet—or I may have missed it. If so, I apologize.
Overall, let’s ensure everything is in order and take a moment to celebrate this achievement—with a strong coffee and new goals ahead!
