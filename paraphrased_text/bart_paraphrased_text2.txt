 During our last discussion, I told him about the new submission we had been waiting for since last fall, but that update was confusing because it didn't include any full feedback from a reviewer or even an editor?
 Anyway, I believe that the team, even if a little late and less communicative in recent days, has really tried their best to be paper-friendly and cooperative.
 I think we should all be grateful for his acceptance and effort until the Springer connection finally came last week.
 Also, please remind me if the doctor is still planning to edit the acknowledgements section before sending it again.
 Since I haven't seen the final part yet, or perhaps missed it, if you have, I apologize.
 All in all, let's make sure everyone is safe and celebrate the outcome with a strong cup of coffee and future goals.
