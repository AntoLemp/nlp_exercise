 Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and in Chinese culture we celebrate it with everything safe and beautiful in our lives.
 I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, my deepest wish.
 I thank you for your report showing our words to the doctor, as well as his next contractual check-up on all of us.
 I received this message so I could see the approved report.
 Actually, I got a message from the professor to show me this some time ago.
 I appreciate the professor's full support for our Springer publication.
