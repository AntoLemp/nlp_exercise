During our last discussion, I shared with him the news of the new submission we had been waiting for last autumn, but the changes were not complete as they did not include full feedback from the reviewer or editor.
Despite experiencing some delays and less communication than in recent days, the team did well on paper and cooperated effectively.
The collective agreement and efforts made until the Springer link was finally announced last week are greatly appreciated, I think.
In case the doctor decides to revise the acknowledgments section before resending, please keep this in mind.
I didn't witness that final segment yet, or maybe I missed it altogether, but if so, I'm sorry.
Let us ensure the safety of all and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
